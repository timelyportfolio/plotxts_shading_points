Adding Points and Shading in R with plot.xts from xtsExtra
======================

This is a very simple example of shading and adding points to a time series chart in R created by the [xtsExtra plot.xts function](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/xtsExtra/?root=xts).  A small change was necessary to the plot.xts function and can be seen within this repo.

Some commentary with the results appear in the [post](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/02/shading-and-points-with-xtsextra-plotxts.html).
